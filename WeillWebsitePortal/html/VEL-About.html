<title>About the Study</title>
<br><br><strong class = TitleClassMain>About the study</strong><br><br>
The purpose of this study is to find interventions which are helpful in treating psychological distress in healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients. There are two phases of the study.

  <br><br><strong class = TitleClass>Phase I:</strong> All participants will take part in Phase I, which consists of either a narrative writing intervention or a medical music intervention. You have been randomly assigned to one of the interventions. Both interventions will be completed in 4 sessions over 2 weeks (sessions are 30 minutes in length). After each session you will be asked to fill out some self-report measures. At the end of the 4 sessions, you will participate in an assessment to reassess your symptoms. Healthcare workers that meet criteria for PTSD will be given the option to participate in Phase II.
  
  <br><br><strong class = TitleClass>Phase II:</strong> Participants are offered a choice between one of two evidence-based treatments for PTSD: Interpersonal Therapy (IPT) or Exposure Therapy (ET). Participants will be allowed to choose a preferred treatment. Both treatments are comprised of ten 75-minute sessions over the course of 5 weeks.
  
  All Participants will complete a final assessment concluding the study. All interventions will be offered using distance technology.
