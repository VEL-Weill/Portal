<title>About the Study</title>
<br><br><strong class = TitleClassMain>About the study</strong><br><br>
  It is expected that large numbers of healthcare workers will experience a broad range of psychological reactions and symptoms including anxiety, depression, moral distress, and trauma symptoms that will cause both significant suffering as well as occupational and social impairment. The purpose of this study is to find interventions which are helpful in treating psychological distress in healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients.

  There are two phases of the study. All participants will take part in Phase I, which consists of 4 sessions of either a narrative writing intervention or a medical music intervention. If you choose to participate you will be randomly assigned to the narrative writing intervention or medical music intervention.

  Following Phase I of the study, healthcare workers who meet criteria for PTSD will be given the option to participate in Phase II of the study, in which they are offered a choice between one of two evidence-based treatments for PTSD: Interpersonal Therapy (IPT) or Exposure Therapy (ET). Participants will be allowed to choose a preferred treatment in Phase II. All interventions will be offered using distance technology.
  <br><br><strong class = TitleClass>Phase I:</strong>All participants will take part in Phase I, which consists of either a narrative writing intervention or a medical music intervention. For Phase I, you will be “randomized” into one of two computer-based interventions: narrative writing or medical music.  Randomization means that you are put into a group by chance. It is like flipping a coin. Neither you nor the researchers will choose what group you will be in. You will have an equal chance of being placed in any group. Both narrative writing and medical music conditions will consist of four sessions over two weeks that are each approximately an hour long (30 minute interventions including time to complete some self-report measures). At the end of the 4 sessions, you will participate in an assessment to reassess your symptoms. Healthcare workers that meet criteria for PTSD will be given the option to participate in Phase II.

  <br><br><strong class = TitleClass>Phase II:</strong>Following the completion of Phase 1 (which coincides with the mid-study assessment), if you are determined to meet the criteria for PTSD, you will be given the choice to receive one of two evidence-based treatments: interpersonal therapy or exposure therapy. Both groups will receive ten approximately 90 minute sessions (75-minute treatment including time to complete some self-report measures). If you do not meet the criteria for PTSD, you will be given treatment referrals as appropriate. All interventions will be offered using distance technology.
